# Implementation Plan: Anime Recommendations

**Branch**: `001-anime-recommendations` | **Date**: 2026-06-27 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)

**Input**: Feature specification from `specs/001-anime-recommendations/spec.md`

## Summary

An anonymous web app where a visitor selects anime genres/themes and (optionally) searches for
favorite titles, then receives a ranked, dynamic set of anime recommendations drawn from a large
catalog. A **deterministic core** (PostgreSQL catalog + multi-signal scoring) shortlists ~25
candidates; an **AI assist** (Claude Haiku 4.5, called only from the backend) re-ranks that
shortlist and writes a short "why you'll like this" per result. Recommendation strength is shown
as friendly bands — **Chef's pick / Recommended / Worth a try** — never a raw number. The system
returns a valid, banded list even when the AI assist is unavailable.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x on Node.js 22 (backend and frontend)

**Primary Dependencies**:
- Backend: NestJS 11, Prisma 6 (ORM + migrations), `@anthropic-ai/sdk`, `nestjs-zod` + Zod (request/response validation & OpenAPI generation), AJV (validating untrusted external catalog JSON)
- Frontend: React 19 + Vite 6, TypeScript, a typed fetch client generated from the OpenAPI contract; **react-i18next** for UI translations (en/es/pt/fr, English default)
- Data: Jikan v4 REST API (MyAnimeList data, no API key) for catalog ingestion

**Storage**: PostgreSQL 16 (no PostGIS). Tables: `anime`, `genre`, `anime_genre`. No user tables (anonymous MVP — taste profile and recommendations are per-request, never persisted).

**Testing**: Vitest (unit) for the scoring engine; Supertest (integration) for the API; Playwright (browser verification of the end-to-end flow).

**Target Platform**: Linux containers. Frontend deployed to Vercel; backend + PostgreSQL deployed to Railway. Docker Compose for local dev parity (Postgres + backend + frontend + NGINX).

**Project Type**: Web application (separate `backend/` and `frontend/`).

**Performance Goals**: Recommendations returned within ~5s p95 (SC-006); the deterministic shortlist query under ~300ms over a catalog of a few thousand titles.

**Constraints**: Low traffic (learning project). Claude API key and DB credentials live only server-side. AI assist operates on a bounded shortlist (~25 items) to keep tokens/cost minimal. Catalog ≈ 2,000–5,000 most-popular SFW titles (plus a flagged explicit set behind the 18+ gate).

**Scale/Scope**: Single feature, ~5 screens/states, one backend service, low concurrency.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

| Principle | Status | How this plan complies |
|-----------|--------|------------------------|
| I. Spec-Driven Development | ✅ | This plan follows the clarified spec; tasks come next via `/tasks`. |
| II. Deterministic Core, AI as Assist | ✅ | Scoring + shortlist are pure SQL/TypeScript; AI only re-ranks/explains the shortlist. `RecommendationsService` returns a valid banded list with the AI step disabled (bands derived from score thresholds). AI output validated before display. |
| III. Secure by Default | ✅ | Claude key + DB URL in backend `.env` (gitignored); frontend calls only the NestJS API. External (Jikan) and AI output treated as untrusted, validated with AJV/Zod. Gitleaks before every commit. |
| IV. Contract-First & Fully Validated | ✅ | OpenAPI contract authored in `contracts/openapi.yaml`; Zod schemas mirror it and validate every request/response at runtime; TypeScript end-to-end. |
| V. Right-Sized Simplicity (YAGNI) | ✅ | No accounts, no caching layer, no queue, no PostGIS. One service, three tables, one external API. Prisma chosen for built-in migrations (justified below). |

**Result: PASS.** No violations requiring Complexity Tracking.

**Structure Decision**: Web-application layout (Option 2) — the spec defines a browser UI plus a
service with a database, and the constitution locks React + NestJS. Code is organized **by
business capability** (`catalog`, `recommendations`, `ai`) rather than technical layers, per the
constitution. The AI integration is isolated to a single module so the secret never leaks and the
deterministic fallback is easy to enforce and test.

## Complexity Tracking

> No Constitution Check violations. One dependency choice worth recording:

| Choice | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|--------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| Prisma ORM | Type-safe DB access + first-class migrations for the catalog schema | Raw SQL / `pg` would require hand-rolled migrations and lose end-to-end types (violates Principle IV's "typed boundaries"); acceptable but more error-prone for a learner. |
